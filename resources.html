    <h1>What is Cybersecurity?</h1>
    <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of securing computer systems from unwanted access, intrusion, modification, or spying. All people who use a computer need to have a basic understanding of best practices online and what cybersecurity professionals do
        so that they can best protect themselves. Cybersecurity is a broad discipline, including encryption/decryption (cryptography), ethical hacking, penetration testing, system configuration, incident response, forensics, and mitigation, antivirus
        development, malware removal/remediation, and so much more. This series of caches will educate you about different aspects of the important field of cybersecurity.

    <br>
    <h1>What should I do to protect myself online?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Create strong passwords that are 10 characters or longer and contain at least three uppercase letters, three lowercase letters, three numbers, and three special characters, such as #, $, or &. Change them every 30 to 90 days.</li>
        <li>Enable the firewall on your devices.</li>
        <li>Ensure that you see 'https' in a website URL when you are making a purchase or disclosing personally identifiable information (PII).</li>
        <li>Do not click on any links in your email that come from an unfamilliar source. They could be phishing.</li>

    </ul>
    <br>
    <h1>What are the different kinds of attacks that happen?</h1>
    <p>Malware is code that damages a system, steals information, or does other bad things when it is run. Everything below is a type of malware.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Phishing Attack: A malicious file or link is sent in an email; when it is run it damages the computer. Other types of malware in the phishing family include spear-phishing (targeting a user based on their affiliation with a group), vishing (on
            a phone call), and smishing (through text messaging/SMS)</li>
        <li>Ransomware: A hacker takes control of a computer system, encrypts and locks the data, and demands a payment, or ransom, in order to restore the system. </li>
        <li>Trojan Horse: A program that a user installs that has a function they want, but also has malware in its code.</li>
        <li>Time/Logic Bomb: Malware that lies dormant until a certain point of criteria has been reached, such as a certain day or time or a user logging into the system.</li>
        <li>Worm: Malware that can spread to other machines without human help.</li>
        <li>Zombies: Computers under the control of an attacker. If your computer is attacked by a zombie, someone else has complete control of your computer.</li>
        <li>Botnet: A collection of zombies that are used to bring down websites with a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack or to send phishing/spam emails.</li>
        <li>Spyware: Malware that collects information about the users on a system.</li>
        <li>Keylogger: Spyware that records all of a user's keystrokes to obtain passwords and PII.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h1>What is Cryptography and how does it relate to Cybersecurity?</h1>
    <p>Cryptography is the practice of encrypting messages or numerical codes so that they can not be read without decrypting them. Here are some common types of cryptographic codes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Caesar cipher: What the Geocaching website uses to encrypt hints. Messages encrypted with a Caesar cipher are shifted forward a set amount of letters. To decrypt the message, one has to shift back the amount of letters the message was encrypted.
            EX: 'Geocaching' with a shift of 5 would read 'Ljthfhmnl'</li>
        <li>Binary to Decimal/Decimal to Binary: Converting to and from the Base 10 number system (decimal) to the Base 2 number system (binary). In Base 2, the only two digits used are 0 and 1, and each time a multiple of 2 is reached, a new place is added.
            <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-binary.html">This resource </a> will help you convert from Decimal to Binary and vice versa. </li>
        <li>Hex to Decimal/Decimal to Hex: Converting to and from the Base 10 number system (decimal) to the Base 16 number system (hex). In Base 16, the digits of 0-9 and A, B, C, D, E, and F are used. Each time a multiple of 16 is reached, a new place is
            added. <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html">This resource</a> will help you convert from Decimal to Hex and vice versa.</li>
        <li>Binary to ASCII: ASCII is a way of representing letters through the binary number system. To convert back and forth, please use <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-ascii.html">this resource</a>.</li>
    </ul>
