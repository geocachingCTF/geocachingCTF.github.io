    <h1> Welcome to the Geocaching Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenge Page! </h1>
</header>

<body>

    <p> This series of caches is designed to educate geocachers in computer security basics, basic cryptography, malware recognition, and more to come. To complete a cache, you must complete the online exercises on this site. There is a resource page with
        information to help you. The challenges will be beginner level, but it is recommended you complete the caches in order, as some knowledge will build upon itself as the series progresses. Once you have successfully completed the exercises, you
        will be given coordinates to where the physical container is located. All containers are placed in a location with a relevant cybersecurity location nearby based on the cache. Some caches in this series have a field puzzle that you will need to
        complete in the field that are related to the exercises you completed on the site. You will need to complete the field puzzle in order to access the contents of the cache.
